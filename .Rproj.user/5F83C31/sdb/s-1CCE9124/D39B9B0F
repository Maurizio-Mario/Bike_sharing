In this project, we focus on the operations of CaBi in 2011 and 2012. In the Excel spreadsheet `data.xlsx`, it contains hourly rental data spanning these two years. Two types of rental data were recorded: casual\nrenters and registered renters. A registered renter is a pre-registered member of the bike sharing program, while a casual renter pays for the use of a bike on the spot using a credit card. In addition to the time/date information (including holidays), the spreadsheet also records the weather condition in each hour (e.g., temperature, wind speed and humidity).  \n\n# Loading the data\n\nWe are going to load in R the whole Excel workbook. Since it is composed by three separated sheets, the package `XLConnect` come in use. It allow to read the entire workbook, and then load the single worksheets. Please note that `XLConnect` requires Java to be pre-installed. \n\nSince the `work_book` is quite small (1728 bytes) w are going to load in memory every sheet like a separate object.\n\n```{r 1}\nlibrary(XLConnect)\nwork_book <- loadWorkbook(\"raw data.xlsx\") \nobject.size(work_book)\n\nnote <- readWorksheet(work_book, sheet=\"Note\")\nall_data <- readWorksheet(work_book, sheet=\"All data\")\ntesting <- readWorksheet(work_book, sheet=\"Testing\")\n```\n\n# Data description\n\n\n# \"Note\" is the coodebook\n# \"All data\" is main dataset\n# \"Testing\" is a second and smaller dataset on which perform a prevision",
